# Controlling-the-Rising-Cost-of-Healthcare-Insurance-in-the-United-States

The goal of this paper is to illustrate what the key factors are in determining the price of insurance
across the United States. We looked at multiple health statistics and insurance prices within different
regions of the country to narrow down what are the leading factors in each region. From here, an
educational aspect was created to inform the public of everyday changes they can make in their lives to
live a healthier life. Changes such as healthier eating habits, more exercise on a daily basis, lower calorie
intake, etc. If those lifestyle habits are not performed correctly, they are direct causes of cardiovascular
disease (CVD), hypertension (HBP), diabetes, cancer, and lower life expectancyâ€™s. On top of this, if
people perform those habits correctly, it is shown that they will have a higher quality of life and reduce
costs of insurance.
